# Experiment 1: Manipulating Datasets using Pandas

## Introduction
This experiment focuses on manipulating datasets using the **Pandas** library in Python. Pandas provides tools for:
- Analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
- Handling large datasets efficiently.
- Creating meaningful insights from raw data.

## Series and DataFrames
Pandas has two main components:
1. **Series**: A one-dimensional array (like a column).
2. **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional table composed of multiple Series.
